# Practical 2 README

In this Practical we look at two different problems.

The first is converting from binary to floating point, and check how many
binary digits are in a number. This is done in the Conversion.f90 file.

This is then followed by computing the sum of 1/n, up to n=1000. This is done
in the Sum.f90 file.
