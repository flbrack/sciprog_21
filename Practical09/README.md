# Practical 9

This week we look at the difference between reading user input and reading from a file.

We write two programs which can tell if a given square matrix is a magic square or not. This is implemented using the functions in the header file magic_square.fh. In one of the programs, the magic square is given via user input, and in the other program, the magic square is read from a file.
