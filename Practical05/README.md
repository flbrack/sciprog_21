# Practical 5

This week we look at user input and pointers.

We first create a simple program that takes user input.

We then create a program that takes a user inputted positive integer and outputs that number of numbers from the fibonacci sequence. This is implemented using pointers.

Finally, we calculate the arctanh function, up to a given precision, which is inputted by the user.
