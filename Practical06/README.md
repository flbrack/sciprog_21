# Practical 6

In this practical we write code for multiplying matrices and use makefiles to simplify the development process.

The basic matrix multiplication code is in matrixmult.f90.

In the folder Step6, this code was split into two files, and a Makefile was created, so that the code can be compiled with the make command.
