# Pracitcal 10

This week we look at recursive functions/subroutines.

We create a program that uses to recursion to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem. This would be extremely difficult to implement using imperative methods, but with a recursive algorithm, we are able to solve it in very few lines of code.
